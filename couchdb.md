# CouchDB

The Cloudnode platform offers a CouchDB database option to store persistent data. The database is connected through a fast local connection. We also provide a SSL secured remote connection, which can be used to access the database remotely or for replication.

### CouchDB Administration

The "My Databases" tab lists your databases. From here you can also create new databases, delete existing database or manage your databases using the Futon Web GUI. You can add sharing rules and manage your map reduce functions. Clicking on a database name opens the database details page, where you find API keys and URLs to externally access you database. 

### Usage Example

We plan to provide example apps that demonstrate how to use Node.js and CouchDB. We are currently preferring cradle to access CouchDB. Cradle can be installed using npm. For details on using npm with your Node VM see [Node package manager](/node-package-manger).
